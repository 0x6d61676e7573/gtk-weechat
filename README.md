High priority (pre-alpha stuff):
Keep track of connection status and display in GUI.
Some basic keyboard shortcuts like switch buffer.
Make colors work in adwaita-dark theme


Low priority (nice to have):
Make hyperlinks clickable.
Add code to fetch and display images.
Make clicking on nick open query buffer.
Implement nick/prefix indentation.
Application icon.
Buffer tree instead of list.
Add option to launch local weechat backend automatically and connect to it (if possible to set up relay from commandline).
Buttons for join/part, add/connect networks.
